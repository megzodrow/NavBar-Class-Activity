            <p>Think of Hawaii and surfing is sure to be one of the first images that come to mind. This incredible sport has played an integral part in the development and identity of the islands, and its roots can be traced back to the 4th century A.D. when Polynesians began to make their way to the islands from Tahiti and the Marquesas. The rich tradition of surfing flourished and the best surf boards and beaches were reserved for royalty. <br><br>

              Sadly, the arrival of Westerners to the islands contributed to the near demise of this rich tradition steeped in art, culture, and religion. A cash economy was created, people had less free time, and Protestant Missionaries discouraged the practice.
              
              By the beginning of the 20th century, surfing was near the brink of extinction. Ironically, those of European descent were instrumental in reviving the sport. Literary giant Jack London, journalist and rolling stone Alexander Hume Ford, and highly-skilled waterman George Freeth joined forces to help revive the fledging tradition. <br><br>
              
              A few years later, Native Hawaiian and supreme waterman Duke Kahanamoku visited southern California on his way to the Summer Olympics in Stockholm and held several surfing demonstrations that sparked a huge interest in the sport on the U.S. Mainland. After winning Olympic gold, Duke toured the world, became a Hollywood favorite, and spread his love of the sport worldwide. His efforts earned him the title ‘The Father of Surfing’.
              
              Thankfully, the beautiful tradition of surfing not only survived, but underwent somewhat of a renaissance. Today, Hawaii is home to the best places to surf in the U.S. and the world. </p>

        <p class="card-text">Waimea Bay, Ehukai Beach (Banzai Pipeline) and Sunset Beach are great places to sunbathe and stroll along the shore—just leave surfing the huge waves to the pros because they can be very dangerous for inexperienced surfers. The months between November and February are the best times to see big wave surfing.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Learning to surf on Maui is a must do. With its gentle breaks and plethora of surf schools, our island is built for learning to surf. Both the South and West side of Maui have numerous breaks made for longboarding. The gradual slope of the ocean contour at these spots make for a gently breaking wave perfect for getting you up and going. Most of our surf schools on Maui guarantee you'll stand up the first time you take a lesson. Many will also rent you a board if you want to try surfing by yourself.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Surfing the Big Island</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Hawaii is the place of birth of surfing as we know it and in our humble opinion still is one of the best countries in the world to surf. Originally surfing here was a royal sport, only practiced by the ancient Hawaiian monarchs. Nowadays, everyone can enjoy surfing. The Big Island is the youngest of the Hawaiian Islands and because of this has fewer beaches and surf spots than the other islands. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t surf on the Big Island!</p>
