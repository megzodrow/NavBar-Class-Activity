            <p>Men and women were forbidden from eating meals together in ancient Hawaii. These rules and regulations went even further—women and other members of society were not allowed to eat food that was served for special occasions. All of this changed in 1819 when King Kamehameha II took away all laws on the Hawaiian islands that were based on religion, including laws that determined where women could eat and what foods could be eaten. To commemorate the decision, King Kamehameha II hosted a meal to eat with women and eradicate the religious taboos for good. This was the beginning of the luau party as we know it today. </p>

        <p class="card-text">A grass skirt is a costume and garment made with layers of plant fibres such as grasses (Poaceae) and leaves that is fastened at the waistline. They were introduced to Hawaii by immigrants from the Gilbert Islands around the 1870s to 1880s although their origins are attributed to Samoa as well.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">The Hula</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Hula is a Polynesian dance form accompanied by chant (Oli) or song (Mele, which is a cognate of "meke" from the Fijian language). It was developed in the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesians who originally settled there. The hula dramatizes or portrays the words of the oli or mele in a visual dance form.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Fire Dancing</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Fire knife dances are a Samoan tradition that have been passed down from generation to generation. These dances began as knife dances, otherwise known as Samoan Ailao. They were used before warriors went to battle as a way to pump them up for war. These dances involve twirling a nifo oti, the traditional name for a war knife. The first man to bring fire into the dance was Letuli Olo Misilagi. His new tradition has stuck ever since. Letuli went on to write a book about the idea and how fire knife twirling came to be. He was known as the “father” of the Samoan Fire Knife.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Modern Hula</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Modern hula arose from adaptation of traditional hula ideas (dance and mele) to Western influences. The primary influences were Christian morality and melodic harmony. Hula ʻauana still tells or comments on a story, but the stories may include events since the 1800s. The costumes of the women dancers are less revealing and the music is heavily Western-influenced.</p>
